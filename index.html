            Richard Paul Astley (born 6 February 1966) is an English singer who
            has been active in music for several decades. He gained worldwide
            fame in the 1980s. Astley became an Internet phenomenon in 2007 when
            the music video for his song "Never Gonna Give You Up" became
            integral to the Rickrolling meme, and his performance career was
            revitalised by the meme's popularity. (Credit: Wikipedia)
